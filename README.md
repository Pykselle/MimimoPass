## How does it work ?


How can it remember your passwords if it doesn't store anything ?  
The thing is, it does not have to remember because it generates them every time you need them.  
The generation algorithm is deterministic :  
Given 1 master password, 1 application name and 1 version number, the generated password will always be the same.  
(The version number is just an increment, starting from 0 and incremented everytime you click on "Generate new password")  
All you have to do is remember one master password, and type it everytime you need a password.


## Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Pykselle/MimimoPass.git 
cd MimimoPass
go build && ./MimimoPass
```
Then go to http://localhost:8080/

###  First use

Now you can log in to the application, and change the password to use the one generated by MimimoPass.
